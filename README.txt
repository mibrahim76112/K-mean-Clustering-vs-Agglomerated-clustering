##Guide to run the code

You Just need to upload your data on Google Collaboratory and run each Cell! 

Explaination of all cells: 

1. Upload the online_shoppers_intention.csv file on the Google Collaboratory

2. Then run the first cell to import all python libraries required for the project

3. Then read the CSV file in order to preprocess by running the next cell of code

4. For pre-processing first apply mean encoding on month and visitor type column and convert Weekend and Revenue column into binary format so we can process numeric data.

5. Now, to deploy k means clustering, run the next cell where using KMeans function we perform K mean clustering on the pre-process data

6. Then run the next cell to obtain Rand index 

7. Similarly, Perform Agglomerative Clustering by running the following cell

8. Calculate Rand index for Agglomerative Clustering 

9. Run the final cell to compare both algorithms
